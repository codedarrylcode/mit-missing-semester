    "## The design of git\n",
    "\n",
    "Git models the history of a collection of files and folders within some top-level directory as a series of snapshots. In Git terminology, a file is called a “blob”, and it’s just a bunch of bytes. A directory is called a “tree”, and it maps names to blobs or trees (so directories can contain other directories).\n",

    "```console\n",
    "<root> (tree)\n",
    "|\n",
    "+- foo (tree)\n",
    "|  |\n",
    "|  + bar.txt (blob, contents = \"hello world\")\n",
    "|\n",
    "+- baz.txt (blob, contents = \"git is wonderful\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Historical snapshots in Git\n",
    "\n",
    "One simple way to look at history is to consider a linear history which contains a list of snapshots in time-order:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "o <-- o <-- o <-- o\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each snapshot in Git refers to a set of “parents”, the snapshots that preceded it. It’s a set of parents rather than a single parent (as would be the case in a linear history) because a snapshot might descend from multiple parents, for example, due to combining (merging) two parallel branches of development.\n",
    "\n",
    "Git calls these snapshots “commit”s. Visualizing a commit history might look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```console\n",
    "# Branching into two seperate streams\n",
    "# e.g. one to fix bug and one to create a new feature\n",
    "# parent <-- child\n",
    "\n",
    "o <-- o <-- o <-- o <---- o # +feature\n",
    "            ^            /\n",
    "             \\          v   # merging branch\n",
    "              --- o <-- o   # +bug fix\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `o`s correspond to individual commits (snapshots). The arrows point to the parent of each commit (it’s a “comes before” relation, not “comes after”). After the third commit, the history branches into two separate branches. \n",
    "\n",
    "This might correspond to, for example, two separate features being developed in parallel, independently from each other. In the future, these branches may be merged to create a new snapshot that incorporates both of the features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objects, references & repositories in Git\n",
    "\n",
    "An object is a tree, blob or commit. References are human-readable names to refer to hash strings (SHA-1) in Git. \n",
    "\n",
    "A git repository contains objects and references. Git commands map to some manipulation of the directed acyclic graph by adding objects and/or adding/updating references.\n",
